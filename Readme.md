# Docre

A clean & easy documentation generator for reason/bucklescript/ocaml.

## How to use:

Get `docre` by running: `npm install --dev jaredly/docre`

```
Usage:
      docre [project title = directory name] [base directory = .] [output directory = ./docs]
        When run with no arguments, the current directory is used.
        You must run bucklescript first to generate the necessary artifacts.

      docre -h
        show this help
```

## Things still to be implemented

* [ ] Interactive code samples!
  * [ ] First pass - include the compiled javascript for code samples so you can see the result
  * [ ] Second pass - make the code samples editable, with an in-page compiler so you can experiment
* [ ] Parse the bsconfig.json and package.json of a project
  * [x] to determine the github url
    * [ ] support all types of github specifications https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json
  * [ ] name, source directories, etc.
* [ ] Handle ocamldoc (see included octavius source) so we can build ocamly projects too

## itemized work to do

* [ ] argument-level documentation
* [ ] add cli options for debug, verbose mode, etc.
* [ ] add cards for social media sharing
* [ ] respect @deprecated (and other things?)
* [x] aliases - only show the last item of a type path (full on hover)
  * if the last item is "t", then also show the parent
* [x] A sidebar!
  * [x] a table of contents
  * [x] listing of other modules in this package
  * [ ] highlight the currently selected thing in the sidebar. scroll-tracking
* [ ] have an "edit this file" link on the page
* [x] make sure mobile looks nice
* [x] make it easy to build for a whole project
* [x] collapse top thing when on mobile
* [x] also process normal markdown files, and add them to the sidebar.
* [x] Integrated search! see [this example](https://rustbyexample.com/primitives/tuples.html?search=thin) (powered by [this rust code](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/blob/5fb36751514a83ce245099df3057efd53b5819df/src/renderer/html_handlebars/search.rs#L19) and [this js code](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/blob/master/src/theme/searcher/searcher.js))
  * [x] will pre-create an elasticlunr index, and load it up when the user selects the search field
  * [x] include the markdown files in the index
  * [ ] maybe allow you to indicate that there are other indexes (e.g. for other libraries) that you'd like to load? So reason's docs could load reasonreact for better cross-searching
* [ ] inline interactive code samples!
  * make them editable! This may require some gymnastics, but I'm confident pack.re can pull it off.
  * on mobile, dont have them be editable. Have a run link that will take you to the playground with the code pre-filled.
  * I'll want a way to specify a "wrapper" for the code, e.g. if it's "in a reprocessing draw function"
  * also specify that the code should have a canvas created adjacent to it?
  * the default should probably be "run in a web worker", but you can override to write to a canvas or similar
  * probably want to lazy-load codemirror, the bucklescript compiler, etc. to be easy on the perf.
  * don't auto-eval, probably. When you click on a codeblock, you can click "run", and then run it. At that point, we'll load the bucklescript compiler? Although maybe we'll include a precompiled version of each inline script because why not.
* [x] Handle markdown files just fine. Include them in the sidebar, process them in a similar way (including allowing interactive inline code samples!). The only difference is there will be no declared items.
* [x] have a zero-config "run this @ the project root and do everyting" mode.
* [ ] integrate into redex, such that it creates documentation for literally everything.

## Thoughts on gitbook-like functionality

Crawl `./docs` looking for markdown files. If there's an `index.md`, that's the main page. Otherwise, we use `Readme.md`.
The main file is always listed at the top in directory listings.

For all other files:

* if a file or directory is prefixed with `\d_`, then that number will be its index in the listing
* files also do the `index.md` or `readme.md` thing (maybe readme.md in the folder as well, for better github browsing?)
* code blocks are magic'd to be editable & evaluable
* links to other pages should work, including to api docs things.
  * you can do an absolute link, and it will work out the relative link, so that if the files are hosted not at the root it will be ok
* should the api docs be placed in `./docs/api`? Maybe. Probably.
* maybe allow you to `@doc` include bits of docs from the api? That could be fun.
* probably want to allow "splat"ing in code from different places. Like example code, etc.

## Example of inline scratchboxes

```reason
print_endline("Hello");
```

When you execute, will trap the console & display below (should also send to real console).
Default is to run in a worker. If you don't want that, you can do

```reason;window
type document;
[@bs.val] external document: document = "";
Js.log2("We can access document", document);
```

You might also want it to execute in an iframe!

```reason;iframe
Js.log("Iframe")
```

```reason;each-iframe
Js.log("This script gets its own iframe.");
```

If you want a setup to happen

```each-setup
Js.log("Gets run before every script. variables are accessible by scripts");
```

```setup
Js.log("Gets run at the very start. variables are not accessible");
```

```each-setup;canvas
Js.log("A canvas is created for each. you can access it as canvasId");
```

```setup;canvas
Js.log("A shared canvas is created, and maybe floats somewhere? idk");
```
